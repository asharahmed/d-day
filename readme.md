# ðŸª– D-Day Beach Landing Troop Movement Visualizer

![alttxt](https://github.com/asharahmed/d-day-beach/blob/main/landing.png?raw=true)

# Description

This is a simple program that visualizes the troop movement of the D-Day beach landings. It is written in Python and uses the Folium library to create the map. The program takes in a CSV file with the troop movement data and outputs an HTML file with the map.

# Usage

To use the program, simply run the following command:
    
        python3 main.py

The program will then output an HTML file called `troop_movements.html` in the same directory. Open this file in a web browser to view the map.

# Future Work

- Add a legend to the map
- Add a slider to the map to allow the user to view troop movements at different points in time
- Add points to display location of ships and aircraft during the landings
- Add more interactivity to the map (e.g. clicking on a troop movement will display the troop movement data)
