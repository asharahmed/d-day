# About the App

This is a simple program that visualizes the troop movement of the D-Day beach landings. It is written in Python and uses the Folium library to create the map. The program takes in a CSV file with the troop movement data and outputs an HTML file with the map.

# About the Beaches and D-Day Landings

The D-Day landings were a series of military operations that took place towards the end of the Second World War. The landings were significant as they allowed the Allies to push back Axis forces and liberate Europe from occupation.

The beaches on D-Day were divided into five sectors: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. The Americans landed on Utah and Omaha, the British on Gold, the Canadians on Juno, and the Free French on Sword. 

Thanks to the efforts of the Allies, the D-Day landings were a success. The Allies were able to secure a foothold on the beaches and begin the liberation of France, which would eventually lead to the end of World War II and an Allied victory.

# Usage

To use the program, simply run the following command:
    
        python3 main.py

The program will then output an HTML file called `troop_movements.html` in the same directory. Open this file in a web browser to view the map.

# Future Work

- Add a legend to the map
- Add a slider to the map to allow the user to view troop movements at different points in time
- Add points to display location of ships and aircraft during the landings
- Add more interactivity to the map (e.g. clicking on a troop movement will display the troop movement data)
